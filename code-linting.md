# Code Linting Guide

Per [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)):

>In computer programming, lint was the name originally given to a particular program that flagged some suspicious and non-portable constructs (likely to be bugs) in C language source code. The term is now applied generically to tools that flag suspicious usage in software written in any computer language. The term lint-like behavior is sometimes applied to the process of flagging suspicious language usage. Lint-like tools generally perform static analysis of source code.

Here is how you install linting tools in both Sublime Text 3 and 

#Atom
