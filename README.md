# Texas Tribune Data Visuals Guides

## [Set up your News Apps computer environment](computer-setup.md)

*BAE*: There are a few things we have to do to get your computer ready for all the cool stuff you're going to build. 

## [GitHub Basics](github-basics.md)

GitHub is an essential tool for our team. If you're new to GitHub or haven't had a chance to collaborate on projects through GitHub, this guide will help you get started. If you ever run into a merge conflict (i.e. everyone) or need a reminder on how to file a pull request, this guide is your best friend.
 
## [Code Linting Guide](code-linting.md)

Code linters are super helpful, and we hope you install them. They'll help you catch bugs and typos, which can save you massive amounts of time, prevent headaches and those moments when you feel really dumb, because you spent an hour trying to solve a problem that turned out to be a missing semicolon. 

## [Build a News Apps Graphic](build-a-graphic.md)

You're finally ready! Here's how basic practices for building embeddable graphics for dailies and short term projects. Keep in mind, we store the sausage for nearly all small daily projects in the [newsapps-dailies](https://github.com/texastribune/newsapps-dailies) repo. You can find lots of code examples there in the other project folders.
